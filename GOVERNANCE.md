# Project Governance

This repository works through the BDFL â€“ Benevolent Dictator For Life - model. That means that a
single maintainer, Dave Rolsky (@autarch), holds all of the admin keys and write access for this
repository. Other users are encouraged to open issues, submit Pull Requests, and to ask for
recognition as maintainers, but all decisions ultimately lie with the core maintainer.

This maintainer is open to others joining on the admin team for this repository, but prospective
admins will need a track record of contributions in the form of PRs and issue responses first.

Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more details on how to file issues and
PRs for this project.
