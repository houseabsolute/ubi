# Reporting Security Issues

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory "Report a Vulnerability" tab.

The project maintainer(s) will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, the maintainer(s) will keep you informed of the progress
towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party packages to the person or team maintaining the package.
