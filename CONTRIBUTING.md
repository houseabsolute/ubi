# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. This file contains instructions that
will help you work with the source code.

Please note that if you have any questions or difficulties, you can reach the maintainer through
GitHub Issues. Filing an issue is the preferred method for reporting bugs or issues with the
development tool configuration for this project.

If you'd like to suggest a small change, you can do that by directly creating a
[Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests). For larger changes, you are encouraged to
file an issue first, so we can discuss the change before you spend too much time implementing it.

Please note that the maintainer, Dave Rolsky (@autarch), mostly works on his FOSS projects in his
free time, which means on weekends and days off. However, he does not work on these things _every_
weekend, so it may be a little while before you get a response to your issue or PR.

If it's been more than 3 weeks since you submitted an issue or PR, feel free to comment on the
submission to nudge the maintainer, who is probably getting sucked into some new video game and
spending all his time there.
